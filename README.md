# RigMod
Random Item Generator (RigMod) for Minecraft 1.16.3 Forge

This mod adds "Random Item Generator" block. Every time you mine this block it will drop a random item. If you mine with a silk touch pickaxe it will drop itself. If you break with a fortune pickaxe it can drop multiple items at once.
